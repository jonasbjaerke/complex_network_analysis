This project explores the structure and properties of a social/music network derived from the **Last.fm Asia dataset**, using graph-theoretic methods, community detection, and feature-based similarity analysis.

The repository is organized to clearly separate:
- **Reusable function logic** (Python module)
- **Exploratory and experimental analysis** (Jupyter notebooks)
- **Raw data inputs**
- **Generated figures** (reproducible, not versioned)
